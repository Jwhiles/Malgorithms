# Malgorithms
Naive implementations of algorithms that I've read about.

* [Shunting-yard Algoritm](https://github.com/Jwhiles/Malgorithms/tree/02963ed3f8e2d38776074934daf06ebd07dffe01/shunting_yard) - converts mathematical expressions into reverse polish notation
* [Evaluate RPN](https://github.com/Jwhiles/Malgorithms/tree/02963ed3f8e2d38776074934daf06ebd07dffe01/evaluate_rpn) - Evaluate reverse polish notation
