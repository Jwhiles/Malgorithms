# Shunting Yard Algorithm 

First described by Dijkstra (the absolute computer) this algorithm is used to
convert standard mathematical expressions into 'reverse polish notation'. I have
no idea why.

Currently this implementation only works for expressions with all operators and
operands seperated by white spaces. So `4 + 5 * ( 5 / 6 )` - works `4+5*(5/6)` -
will not work.

Currently only these operators are recognised `/ * + - ^`
